This program was built as a midterm project in the summer of 2020 while attending school at Skill Distillery. It was developed over an eight day sprint.

Here's why:
* We wanted to create a project that could be useful
* The project needed to demonstrate full CRUD capabilities
* Lastly, we thought it was a super cool idea!

Team members and roles:
* Shane Duncan (Developer, SME)
* Sergio Samoiloff (Developer, DBA)
* Jacob Zieleniewski (Developer, Front End Design)

The purpose of this program is to connect people together who share a common interest in table top gaming. The use of the site is similar in nature to other event connection sites. Without being logged in a user can view upcoming events and browse all of our current game offerings. Once they register and log in they can join specific events, create new events, leave events, and make community comments on events. The site also has a full feature account section where they can edit their profile, see all their upcoming events they're signed up for, all previous events they attended, and make modifications to any events they might be hosting.

## Lessons Learned

1. Communication - During this project we learned that you can never have too much communication. Without being in constant contact throughout the day we could have never successfully collaborated on this project.

2. Teamwork -  Working together to make decisions as a unit proved to be essential in completing a full stack application

3. Sprint Dedication - This was the first full stack sprint we have ever done, doing so really demonstrated the amount of dedication needed to complete projects of this size during an eight day sprint. During the course of this sprint we had several team members lose internet more than once, and even had one team member get struck by lightening! Despite all the obstacles involved the team pulled together and made it happen.
